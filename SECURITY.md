# Security Policy

The AsyncAPI Initiative is committed to maintaining the security of our open source projects. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions. If you discover a vulnerability, follow the steps below to report it responsibly.

## Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure

At AsyncAPI, we follow the [coordnated vulnerability diclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_vulnerability_disclosure). Please do not open an issue, do not notify us in public, and do not disclose this issue to third parties. We take security seriously and appreciate your discretion.

## How to Report a Vulnerability

Use one of the following methods to report a vulnerability:

### GitHub Security Form

Submit a private report using GitHub‚Äôs security advisory form:

[Report a vulnerability](https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/security/advisories/new)

This form allows you to privately share details with the maintainers. We‚Äôll use [GitHub Security Advisories]() to fix and publish information about the vulnerability once resolved.

### Email

Alternatively, send an email to: **security@asyncapi.io**

Include the following in your report:
- Affected project and version
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes or mitigation

## Review Timeline

We aim to review all vulnerability reports within **5 days** of receipt.

## Resolution Timeline

Once validated, we typically resolve security issues within **30 business days**. Complex issues may take longer, but we‚Äôll keep you updated throughout the process.

## Incident Handling Process

Here‚Äôs how we handle reported vulnerabilities:

1. **Review** the report and validate the issue.
2. **Triage** severity and impact.
3. **Fix** the vulnerability in a private branch.
4. **Disclose** the fix using GitHub Security Advisories.
5. **Publish** a security advisory and notify our users.

## Bounty Program

AsyncAPI is an open source initiative maintained by the community. We currently **do not offer monetary bounties** for vulnerability disclosures. However, we deeply appreciate your contribution and may acknowledge your efforts publicly if you wish.


üìù Note: If you‚Äôre contributing to AsyncAPI projects, follow secure coding practices and keep dependencies up to date. We regularly audit our codebase and generate SBOMs to ensure compliance and transparency.
