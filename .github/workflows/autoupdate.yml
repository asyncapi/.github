# This workflow is centrally managed in https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/
# Don't make changes to this file in this repo as they will be overwritten with changes made to the same file in above mentioned repo

# This workflow will run on every push to the repository or comment with /update or /u. And will create merge-commits for all PRs to respective branches.
# This also works with forks, not only with branches in the same repository/organization.
# Currently, does not work with forks in different organizations.

# This workflow will be distributed to all repositories in the AsyncAPI organization.
