# This workflow is centrally managed in https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/
# Don't make changes to this file in this repo as they will be overwritten with changes made to the same file in above mentioned repo

# Purpose of this workflow is to allow people to merge PR without a need of maintainer doing it. If all checks are in place (including maintainers approval) - JUST MERGE IT!
