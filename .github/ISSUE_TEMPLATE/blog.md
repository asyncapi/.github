## Guide
Here are a few steps you can follow to write a blog post for AsyncAPI:

1. After getting some feedback on the issue, fork the `website` [repository](https://github.com/asyncapi/website)
2. Add a new markdown file [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/tree/master/pages/blog) with proper metadata (front matter) and the article content, as other posts have. The content of the article is up to you, it just needs to mention "AsyncAPI"
3. Add a cover image. In case you need some inspiration we recommend https://unsplash.com/. All images should be placed [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/website/tree/master/public/img/posts) into a folder that has the same name as the markdown file created a step before. Also, make sure to have the following:
    * **Compress the image as much as possible**, we recommend https://squoosh.app/
    * The output format needs to be `.webp`
    * Include a clear `alt` description for people that cannot see images
4. Run the website locally or with Gitpod by using instructions from the `README` to test your changes
5. Open a PR with your blog post and test your changes with a preview of the site on Netlify.
6. Maintainers will review the article (e.g. language, images) and potentially ask for improvements
7. Once it gets merged it will be available live in production :rocket:

We encourage you to write a blog post and sharing it with the community. We can't wait to read it :smile:!
