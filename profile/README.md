## ✨ Welcome
Welcome to the Open-Source (OSS) [AsyncAPI Initiative](https://www.asyncapi.com/), part of [the Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/en/press-release/linux-foundation-will-host-asyncapi-to-support-growth-and-collaboration-for-industrys-fastest-growing-api-spec/). 

AsyncAPI seeks to improve the current state of Event-Driven Architectures (EDAs) and the tooling system around them. ❤️
